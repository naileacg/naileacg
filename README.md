## Hi! I'm Nailea :smile_cat:

- I'm currently finishing my Computer Engineering degree.
- I've always been a bit of a nerd, and honestly, that hasn't changed a bit—probably explains my love for coding. ✨
- I absolutely love learning and discovering new things—curiosity is just part of who I am.
- Lately, I've been super into Artificial Intelligence. :running:
